Hello viewersss!!!

My name is Trixie. I was interesting in coding couple years ago. For me learning to code is a bit of challenging but I really like the feeling when I got my program run. Beside coding, I also loved math. I like anything that logic related. My goals for the next 2 years are to graduate and be able to start my own gaming project.
Today is Oct 29, 2019.
